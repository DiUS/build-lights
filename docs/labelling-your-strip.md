# Labelling your strip

During our hacks we found a cheap solution that works considerably well for small teams - up to 8 or 10 people sitting in the same area. You will only need:

* Blutack
* Printer

The end solution is a light box that wraps the LED strip, diffusing the strength of the lights and providing a visual representation of jobs and the segments they are associated with.

Here's [the actual template](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1-rQuFqg4z3RO-FI1cdysogAHEoRZClWhVqjriqZoR-w/edit) for you - you will need access to Google Drive. It was made to suit the Adafruit LED strip but it can be easily adapted to EpiStar lights as well.

It looks like this:
