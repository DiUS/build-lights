# Getting started

You don't have to get in touch with DiUS to get everything sorted. Even though we would love to help you get started in your IoT journey, you still can set all this at your house.

There are two simple steps required to get the build lights going:

1. [Get the hardware properly wired](/docs/started/hardware.md)
2. [Get the software working](/docs/started/software.md)

OK maybe not quite so simple. The hardware part can be a bit tricky if you don't have much experience with soldering but it is very manageable and we provide some nice instructions for you.
