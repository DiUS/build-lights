DiUS Build Lights is a device that provides visual feedback of a Continuous Integration (CI) or Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline.

The software in the device constantly polls the CI/CD server and displays the various gate or project status on an LED strip. Each section of the LED strip represents a gate or project, and the color represents the status of that gate or project.

It is an effective way of providing constant visual feedback and it can be very useful in agile software development.

#### Features at a glance

* Monitors a number of CI servers.
* Automatically divides LEDs to each build.
* Sets LED colours according to build status.

Check the [road map](/docs/roadmap.md) for our planned features.
